	Notes: .LDR (lego drawing) files are basically a text file with a bunch of lines, with each line
	representing something different. If the line begins with the number 1, then the line represents a lego brick.
	Several space-separated numbers follow the number 1, and these represent the x, y, z coordinates of the brick, the
	colour of the brick, and a transformation matrix for changing the orientation of the brick. The line ends with a
	file name/part number, which can be used to obtain information about the part from Rebrickable.
